            <b>Project description</b><br/>
            <p>Trove has an extensive collection of Photos, both modern and historic, to chronical Australia's history.
            Australians from past decades are often depicted in Photos which catpure the curtural hertiage of the times.
        Photos, however, are typically difficult to tag and search, and in the past relied heavily on mannual annotation. This project hopes to automate that process by providing a Javascript plug-in to use a free face detection and demographic classification service called CeeQ API (<a href="http://ceeqapi.com">http://ceeqapi.com</a>), created by one of the team members. </p>
        <p>The <a href='photo_info.html'>demo site</a> was originally meant to load photos from the Trove API, however, the API did not provide the full sized image, so it was then redesigned to take in a photo URL instead. The video shows the demo applied to several Trove Flickr 'Australia in Pictures' photos.</p>
