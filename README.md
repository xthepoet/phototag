Photo Search - Find out more about your photos

GovHack 2013

Project description:

Trove has an extensive collection of Photos, both modern and historic, to chronical Australia's history. Australians from past decades are often depicted in Photos which catpure the curtural hertiage of the times. Photos, however, are typically difficult to tag and search, and in the past relied heavily on mannual annotation. This project hopes to automate that process by providing a Javascript plug-in to use a free face detection and demographic classification service called CeeQ API (http://ceeqapi.com), created by one of the team members.

The demo site was originally meant to load from the Trove API, however, the API did not provide the full sized image, so it was then redesigned to take in a photo URL.
